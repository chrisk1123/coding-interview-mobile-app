Overview
========

The goal of this exercise is to write a simple mobile application that will display information about weather data, given a source of data from the Environment Canada's API.

The Task 
=========

Data
----

The data can be accessed in a number of forms, including JSON, CSV, and XML. How you access the data is up to you, but you can find some useful information about making an API request to this data source here (<https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.edmonton.ca/s4ws-tdws>).

You shouldn't need to get an API key for the purposes of this submission, it's unlikely you will hit the request limits. 

The Problem
-----------

Write an Flutter application that connects to the data source provided above and displays the data. Work through the steps below to implement the application in stages. It's worth reading through all the steps even if you don't make it to the end. We don't necessarily expect you to make it to the end and prefer you concentrate on the quality of your implementation than completing all the tasks in the time.

1.  Connect up to the data source and retrieve the data.

1.  On the first screen, show a list of weather stations. Please display the station name and formatted date. Your app should launch to this list screen.

1.  Add a second screen, display the max/min temperatures recorded from a weather station. The user should always be able to switch between this screen and the previous list view
